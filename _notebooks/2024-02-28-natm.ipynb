    "\n",
    "## Overview of the **Skills Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Skills Feature** in Pawnsy enables users to manage their skills with full **CRUD operations**, ensuring they can **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** skill entries.\n",
    "- Each user has their own **data stored in a list**, meaning skills are stored in a **user-specific** table within an **SQLite3 database**.\n",
    "- The implementation consists of both **frontend** and **backend** components for a seamless experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm**: The feature follows a structured **algorithm** where user input triggers database operations, ensuring each skill entry is properly handled.\n",
    "- **Procedures**: Defined **procedures** handle adding, updating, and deleting skills, ensuring organized program logic.\n",
    "  - Each **procedure** takes **parameters** such as skill name and proficiency level to execute database operations correctly.\n",
    "- **Selection**: **Selection** statements check if a user has entered valid skill data before saving it.\n",
    "- **Iteration**: **Iteration** is used to retrieve and display all skills associated with a user efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Program Functionality & Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: Users enter skill name and proficiency level.\n",
    "- **Processing**: The system executes **procedures** to store or update skill data in the database.\n",
    "- **Output**: The updated skill list is displayed in the user interface, allowing modifications as needed.\n",
    "- **Program code segment**: The backend consists of a structured **code segment** that handles database queries and ensures users only access their own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security & Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **collection type** used is a structured database table that organizes skills per user.\n",
    "- **List being used**: Each user interacts with their own **list**, meaning their skills remain private and separate from others.\n",
    "- **Student-developed procedure/algorithm**: The core logic for skill management is custom-built, leveraging **student-developed procedures and algorithms** to handle data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Skills Feature** effectively utilizes **iteration, selection, sequencing, and procedures** to create a robust, interactive experience.\n",
    "- The **program functionality** ensures that user data is securely stored and can be efficiently modified.\n",
    "- By implementing these **computer science principles**, Pawnsy provides an intuitive and structured approach to managing user skills.\n",

The second line of code creates newList2, which contains [20, 40, 60, 80]. The third line of code creates bothList, which contains [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The fourth line of code creates uniqueList, which contains [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80].

    "# Next Steps\n",
    "Want to pursue a career in medicine, but as a highschooler the closest thing towards the medical field is research and internships. Using my CSP skills I will start applying to various internship positions, and additionally expand on them. In the future I plan on taking CSA, most likely in my 12th grade. In college, I want to major in neuroscience, so I can use the knowledge I've acquired through CSP and CSA in highschool to apply for more higher level internships, and further my CS portfolio as I can begin using neural networks to understand how the brain processes information. \n",
