    "  This code segment creates‚ÄánewList1, containing the unique elements from‚Äálist1, and‚ÄánewList2, containing the unique elements from‚Äálist2. These two lists are combined to form‚ÄábothList. Any elements that appear in both lists are removed from‚ÄábothList‚Äáto form‚ÄáuniqueList. The correct count is the difference between the lengths of‚ÄábothList‚Äáand‚ÄáuniqueList. For example, assume that‚Äálist1‚Äácontains‚Äá[10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]‚Äáand‚Äálist2‚Äácontains‚Äá[20, 20, 40, 60, 80].

The third line of code creates‚ÄábothList, which contains‚Äá[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The fourth line of code creates‚ÄáuniqueList, which contains‚Äá[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80]. Since‚ÄábothList‚Äácontains 10 elements and‚ÄáuniqueList‚Äácontains 7 elements, the correct result‚Äá3‚Äáis assigned to‚Äácount.\n",

The book details the Major AP CSP concepts and I found it really helpful, I spent a lot of time on this MC and that's because I don't feel really confident in the topics and I was distracted. I spent lots of time second guessing myself.  So going forward I will take more practice tests, such as the ones included in the book. \n",
