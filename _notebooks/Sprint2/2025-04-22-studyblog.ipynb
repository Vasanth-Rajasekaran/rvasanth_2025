    "## Struggled Past Topics Topics:\n",
    "These are the areas I consistently missed or had trouble with across multiple exams:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 – Identifying and Correcting Errors: I need to be more careful when evaluating all the options instead of jumping on the first one that looks right. Even though I did okay, I missed a couple of questions due to rushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 – Variables and Assignments: This came up again as a weakness. Even though I improved a bit, I still missed some questions here, which shows I haven’t fully nailed the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.12 – Calling Procedures: I misunderstood the logic in a code segment that involved list operations. I need to review this more deeply, especially the flow of data through function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.5 – Legal and Ethical Concerns: I missed a question on Creative Commons. I understood the general idea but didn’t apply it properly in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.6 – Safe Computing: I got a phishing question wrong. It was a simple mistake, but it highlights the need to pay more attention to real-world computing impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Topics I Missed:\n",
    "These topics are new to my list of errors, so I clearly need more exposure to them:\n",
    "\n",
    "3.8 – Iteration: I clicked the wrong option — probably just a misclick, but I’ll still go back and double-check I’m confident here.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.9 – Developing Algorithms: I got confused between two very similar programs. I need to slow down and trace code more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics I Improved In:\n",
    "These were previously weak areas where I saw a noticeable improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 – Logical Operators: I’ve clearly done some good work here — I’m now consistently getting these right.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 – Variables and Assignments: I’ve improved, but I’m not out of the woods yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.17 – Lists and Traversals: Happy to see growth here — I’ve become much more confident navigating list structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan Going Forward:\n",
    "To strengthen my performance, I’ll focus on reviewing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4, 3.1, 3.12, 5.5, 5.6, 3.8, and 3.9\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll rewatch the AP Daily Videos, especially for 1.4 (Videos 1–3), and read through the Fiveable Study Guides for each topic I missed. I’ll also revisit the questions I got wrong and the ones I got right but felt unsure about, to solidify my understanding.\n",

    "Prior to this exam, I purchased an AP Computer Science Principles Prep Book, which I studied in addition to the lessons we went over. The book details the Major AP CSP concepts and I found it really helpful, I spent a lot of time on this MC and that's because I don't feel really confident in the topics and I was distracted. I spent lots of time second guessing myself.  So going forward I will take more practice tests, such as the ones included in the book. \n",

    "What I’ll Do Going Forward:\n",
    "🎯 Skill 2.B: Implement and Apply an Algorithm\n",
    "This skill is all about writing and tracing algorithms — loops, conditionals, procedures, and how data flows through them. If you're missing questions here, it's often due to either not fully understanding control flow or making assumptions about how code executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I’ll Do Going Forward:\n",
    "Practice Tracing, Not Just Solving:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll force myself to trace at least 5 new College Board-aligned multiple-choice questions a day by hand before choosing an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each line of code, I’ll write out what the variable values are — especially in loops and nested conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code the Algorithm Myself:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll recreate tricky MCQ questions in Python or Snap!, then tweak values and conditions to see how the behavior changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll also write similar algorithms myself (e.g., “Create a program that finds the first repeated element in a list”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use CodeHS or Replit Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll do 10–15 min daily of short algorithmic challenges that involve iteration, logic, and list manipulation. The key is to implement, not just read.\n",
    "\n",
    "AP Daily Rewatch — Especially 3.8 and 3.9:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll rewatch the videos and pause at each step to mentally simulate what the code is doing before it plays out.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Skill 3.B: Use Abstraction to Manage Complexity\n",
    "This skill tests your ability to understand and use procedures/functions, parameters, and variables to reduce repetition and isolate functionality — basically, clean code principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I’ll Do Going Forward:\n",
    "Focus on Function Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll practice taking messy code and refactoring it into a clean function with parameters. (e.g., Instead of repeating code to filter data, write a reusable filterList(data, condition) function.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll analyze AP problems and ask: What can be abstracted here into a reusable piece?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Dive into 3.12 (Calling Procedures):\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll work through questions involving multiple procedures, especially ones that manipulate lists or pass parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll diagram input/output for each function in these questions to better understand data flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse-Engineer MCQs:\n",
    "\n",
    "For every function-based MCQ I get wrong, I’ll rewrite the question into a full program, run it, and experiment with changing arguments or the function definition to see what breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiveable + AP Classroom Videos:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll watch AP Daily 3.12 again and take notes on when and why a procedure is called — not just how.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll read the Fiveable summaries and practice identifying where abstraction fails — i.e., when it’s not used and the code becomes hard to read.\n",
