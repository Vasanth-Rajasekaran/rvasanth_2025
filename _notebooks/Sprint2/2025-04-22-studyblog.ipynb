    "These are the areas I consistently missed or had trouble with across multiple exams:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 – Identifying and Correcting Errors: I need to be more careful when evaluating all the options instead of jumping on the first one that looks right. Even though I did okay, I missed a couple of questions due to rushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 – Variables and Assignments: This came up again as a weakness. Even though I improved a bit, I still missed some questions here, which shows I haven’t fully nailed the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.12 – Calling Procedures: I misunderstood the logic in a code segment that involved list operations. I need to review this more deeply, especially the flow of data through function calls.\n",

    "5.5 – Legal and Ethical Concerns: I missed a question on Creative Commons. I understood the general idea but didn’t apply it properly in context.\n",

    "These topics are new to my list of errors, so I clearly need more exposure to them:\n",

    "Topics I Improved In:\n",
    "These were previously weak areas where I saw a noticeable improvement:\n",

The book details the Major AP CSP concepts and I found it really helpful, I spent a lot of time on this MC and that's because I don't feel really confident in the topics and I was distracted. I spent lots of time second guessing myself.  So going forward I will take more practice tests, such as the ones included in the book. \n",
