# Showcasing My Projects at Night at the Museum 🎉

**June 2025 • Student Developer Journal**

---

This year in **AP Computer Science Principles** has been nothing short of transformative. I walked in knowing the basics—and walked out having built full-stack applications that solve real problems. Our final milestone? **Night at the Museum**.

It wasn’t your average school event. Picture a tech expo meets community open house: every project on display, every student ready to explain, debug, and demo in real time. No pressure, right?

## From Idea to Interaction

I showcased two major projects:  
- **Pyre** — our wildfire prediction and response planning chatbot  
- **Pawnsy** — a full-stack chess training platform powered by a custom skills API

Both started with a problem and grew through months of design, coding, feedback, more coding, and iteration (plus caffeine). Getting to finally share them with visitors—parents, peers, teachers, and total strangers—was surreal.

Some highlights:  
✔️ Watching a fifth grader play Pawnsy and instantly understand the analysis system  
✔️ Hearing an adult say, “Wait, you *built* this?”  
✔️ Answering questions about backend architecture like it was second nature  

It reminded me: software is never just for developers. It’s for people.

## Lessons on Display

Beyond the projects, the event was a crash course in communication:
- **Explain clearly** (no buzzwords, no babble)  
- **Show, don’t just tell**  
- **Listen to feedback**—some of the best ideas come from fresh eyes  

More than just a grade, this was a chance to own the work. To represent the team. To stand behind the code.

## Gratitude & Growth

Major thanks to **Mr. Mortensen** and **Ms. Pataki** for pushing us to think critically, code confidently, and never settle for “good enough.” Their insistence on iteration, reflection, and real-world relevance made the class feel more like a dev internship than a high school course.

## Final Thoughts

Night at the Museum wasn’t just a showcase. It was a celebration—of progress, persistence, and possibility. I walked out not just proud of the work, but excited for what’s next.

🚀 On to more building, more learning, and more late nights staring at bug logs.
