Hi my name is Vasanth Rajasekaran, and I'm a sophmore at Del Norte Highschool. AP Computer Science Principles is my first computer science class at Del Norte, and I lookforward to bettering my computer science skills throughout this course. I have a German Shepherd named Tiger, and I got him this summer. In my freetime I enjoy watching basketball🏀 and playing badminton🏸.
