## Week 1:
During this week, I focused on setting up the necessary tools we need for this course.

## Downloaded Basic Tools:
    Installed VSCode
    Installed WSL
    Installed Python3
    Installed Ruby
    Installed Bundler

## Applications Installed:
    Created a Slack Account
    Joined Nighthawk Slack Channel
    Created a GitHub Account
    Created own repository

## Week 2:
I spent this week focusing on my front end page development and trying to incorporate the SASS and Frontend hacks. I played around with several themes, until I settled with Dracula. I also tried my best to incorporate Mario into my page, while having a Riddle generator on my home page. During this week, I also created a blog with my partner Xavier, in which we have a mini easter egg that shows our cooperative work. Towards the end of this week, I spent my time adding exciting components, such as embedding a Spotify song and creating a button that links to a youtube video. Lastly, I discovered how to edit my text, by changing it's font, color, and bolding it. 

## Week 3:
During the final week of our first project, I started developing Games with the help of ChatGPT. I additionally used ChatGPT to explain how the code works, which I placed in a series of Jupyter Notebooks that explained the code behind each game. I also spent my time polishing up my project and making sure I completed all the hacks. Lastly, I performed a self evaluation and a peer grade during the class prior to the project due date.
