**What I Learned:**
- **Adaptability is essential:**
  - David Tomasz from the FBI shared that sometimes you’re thrown into situations you don’t expect, and you have to learn quickly and adapt, especially in tech roles like cybersecurity.
- **Integrity and Honesty matter:**
  - Tricia Mercer explained how someone within an organization was stealing data and selling it, which highlighted how important honesty and trust are in this field.
- **Security starts with basics:**
  - Many people don’t know basic security practices, which creates major vulnerabilities. There needs to be more education around this.
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities are dangerous:**
  - These are security flaws with no known fix.
  - For example, if a hacker inserts a fake Microsoft update into the cloud, many systems could be compromised.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Be curious and cautious:**
  - Always ask questions and stay alert when working with data and technology.
- **Cybersecurity is a growing field:**
  - Victor Nzeata discussed how security tasks like identifying and deleting old, lingering data are essential. Jobs in areas like healthcare IT and AI security are on the rise.
- **Soft skills are important:**
  - Being kind, reliable, and a strong communicator is just as valuable as being technically skilled.
- **Ethical hacking is a valuable tool:**
  - Building and testing your own systems or networks can help you learn real-world skills.
- **Make technical ideas easy to understand:**
  - Tricia Mercer pointed out that when working with businesses, you need to explain complex ideas in simple language they can act on.
- **Group work teaches flexibility:**
  - David Tomasz also noted that in team projects, there’s always someone who doesn’t pull their weight. Learning how to work around that is part of being successful.

**What I Plan To Do Next:**
- Learn IT and cybersecurity basics to build a strong foundation.
- Participate in hackathons and create my own networks to gain hands-on experience.
- Improve my teamwork and communication skills by continuing to work with my group in CSP.
- Stay informed about AI and cybersecurity trends to be ready for the future job market.
- Look into certifications or internships in cybersecurity.
- Practice explaining complex ideas clearly to non-technical audiences.
- Join cyber classes and join the Cyber CEO club to gain more experience.
