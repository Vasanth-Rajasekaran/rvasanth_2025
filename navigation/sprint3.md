# Key Topcs to Revise

### Design and Evaluate Computational Solutions  
This topic is about creating solutions to problems using technology and figuring out if they work effectively. It means understanding the problem, designing a logical way to solve it, and then checking if the solution is efficient and does what it’s supposed to.

### Develop Programs that Involve Abstractions  
This focuses on using abstractions in programming, like breaking down complex tasks into simpler pieces by creating functions or reusable parts of code. It’s about managing complexity and making programs easier to read and use.

### Investigating Computing Innovations  
This involves exploring new technologies or ideas in computing, like AI, self-driving cars, or cybersecurity. The goal is to understand how these innovations work, their benefits, and the potential ethical or societal challenges they bring.

### Evaluate and Test Algorithm Programs  
This is all about looking at algorithms (step-by-step instructions in code) and testing them to see if they’re efficient, accurate, and reliable. It’s like debugging but also includes checking for ways to make the program better.

# Key Missed Questions:

## Question 63  
**Skill 4.C: Identify and correct errors in algorithms and programs, including error discovery through testing.**  
This question is asking which line of code would need to be removed for the code to work as intended.  

I selected options **C and D**, because I thought the `count ← count + 1`. This was due to a lack of content understanding regarding coding.  

The correct answers were options **B and D**:  
- **B is correct.** If `count` is set to 0 repeatedly inside the loop, it will not provide an accurate count of the number of prime numbers in the list.  
- **D is correct.** If `count` is incremented outside the `IF` statement, it will increase for all entries in the list instead of just the prime entries.

## Question 60  
**Skill 3.C: Explain how abstraction manages complexity.**  
This question is asking which of the ways a programmer can use abstraction to manage the complexity of a program.  

I selected options **B and D**.  

The correct answers were options **A and D** because:  
- **A is correct.** Placing repeated code with procedure calls is an example of a procedural abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.  
- **D is correct.** Creating a list of names is an example of a data abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.  

**To practice this skill, I will watch both of the 3.13 AP Daily Videos.**

## Question 58  
**Skill 1.C: Explain how collaboration affects the development of a solution.**  
This question is asking which of the following statements is true regarding crowdsourcing.  

I selected option **D**, due to a lack of content understanding.  

The correct answer was **D** because:  
- **D is correct.** The Internet can provide tools, information, and knowledge to crowdsourcing participants and can lower geographic barriers to potential participants. However, there exist problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time, even with a distributed approach.  

**To practice this skill, I will watch 5.4 AP Daily Video 1.**

## Question 55  
**Skill 4.B: Determine the result of code segments.**  
This question tasked us with analyzing a section of code and identifying what is causing the error.  

I selected option **A**, due to a lack of content understanding.  

The correct answer was **A** because:  
- **A is correct.** The expression `((response = "y") AND (response = "yes"))` always evaluates to false because it is not possible for the variable `response` to be equal to both `"y"` and `"yes"`. Therefore, the procedure will always return false.

## Question 54  
**Skill 3.C: Explain how abstraction manages complexity.**  
This question tasked us to identify a generalization of the procedures.  

I selected option **B**, due to a lack of content understanding.  

The correct answer was **A** because:  
- **D is correct.** The procedures `square` and `cube` are each used to determine a power of `n`. A generalization of this procedure is `Power(n, m)`, which calculates `n` raised to the `m` power.

# Sprint 3 Memories:

Majority of my work in Sprint 3, was focused on developing the fron end page. With my group mates, we were able to create a custom banner for our Chess Room, and then also develop a custom banner for our whole class's room. Additionally I created a drop down menu for our group. Sprint 3, was a crucial project as I was able to develop my coding skills and bridge together the gap between Sprint 1 and Sprint 2, enhancing my knowledge on coding.
